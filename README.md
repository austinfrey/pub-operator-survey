# SSB Pub Operator Survey

A survey created by the Community Infrastructure Learning Group to gather basic pub-related stats from Scuttlebutt pub operators. The results of the survey are intended to inform future activities of the CILG (ie. creating documentation and learning materials, guiding software development).

To complete the survey, click on the 'Issues' tab (above), then click the green 'New issue' button, then click the green 'Get started' button. Answer all questions and submit.

Results will be collated by the CILG and shared on SSB and GitHub.
